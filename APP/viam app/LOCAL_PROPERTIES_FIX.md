# LocalProperties Fix for Flutter Build

## Problem Identified
```
Could not get unknown property 'localProperties' for project ':app' of type org.gradle.api.Project.
```

## Root Cause
The Flutter integration code was trying to use `localProperties` object before it was defined. The `localProperties` object needs to be created and loaded from the `local.properties` file before it can be used.

## Solution
Add the proper `localProperties` initialization before it's used:

```gradle
def localProperties = new Properties()
def localPropertiesFile = rootProject.file('local.properties')
if (localPropertiesFile.exists()) {
    localPropertiesFile.withReader('UTF-8') { reader ->
        localProperties.load(reader)
    }
}

def flutterRoot = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.sdk')
if (flutterRoot == null) {
    throw new GradleException("Flutter SDK not found. Define location with flutter.sdk in the local.properties file.")
}

apply from: "$flutterRoot/packages/flutter_tools/gradle/flutter.gradle"
```

## Why This Works
1. **Proper Initialization**: Creates the localProperties object first
2. **File Loading**: Loads properties from local.properties file if it exists
3. **Safe Access**: Ensures flutter.sdk is available before using it
4. **Standard Pattern**: Follows the standard Flutter Gradle configuration

## Files Updated
- `android/app/build.gradle` - Added localProperties definition before usage

This should resolve the "Could not get unknown property 'localProperties'" error.
